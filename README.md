#What is this? 
sweet expressions for EDN. Lets just jump into an example:

    :cats
      :cordelia
        :name "cordelia"
        :age 6
      :tofu 4
      :margaret 3
    :dogs
      :schnitzel
        :favorite-toys [:ball1 :ball2 :ball3]
      
Hopefully from the above it is apparent that we are implicitly in a Map as (for me at least) this is my most common way of using EDN. 

Other than that Vectors, Sets, and Lists still require [] #[], and () to be used. This is also true for all other EDN data types.
